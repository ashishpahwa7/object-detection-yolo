## Real Time Yolo Object Detection
This code is the implementation of (Yolov3)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767] This object detection technique is being used widely in many industrial sectors. It can be said that yolov3 is a competitor of (SSD)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325]. Yolov3 can be used where speed is an important criteria. On the other hand, SSD can be used where is accuracy is the main criteria. Earlier methods, Yolov3 is In tradional techniques (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN), a sliding window tried to locate objects in an image which is quite time consuming. Faster R-CNN uses Region Proposal Network (RPN) to identify bouding boxes. Yolov3 takes a completely different approach towards object detection. First it divides the image into grid of cells. Each cell is responsible for finding bounding boxes.
